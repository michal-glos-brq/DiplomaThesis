## Abstract and introduction

## Theoretical introduction
#### Motivation for Lunar Pits
#### Current state of Lunar Pit research
 - Geology
 - Recon
 - Lunar Pit Atlas
## Space data engineering

#### SPICE
 - What is that?
 - Define the operation, use nice SPICE images demonstrating the transformations and stuff
 - Introduce SPICE kernels used in the thesis
#### Kernel Management
 - Kernel objects
	 - Static kernels
	 - Temporal Kernels
	 - Custom lunar DSK model
 - Kernel management
	 - How to create custom SPICE context
	 - Open architecture - MixIn
## Data processing pipeline
 - Limitations of datasets (motivation for custom pipeline)
 - Instruments
 - What instruments are used
	 - How are instruments implemented
	 - Specific instruments
		 - Subinstruments, geometry, implementation
		 - Specs
		 - Some other remarks
 - Simulation loop
 - Data aggregator
 - Distributed setup and infrastructure

## Data analysis
 - What data are we processing - Lunar Pit areas and chosen swaths of terrain (Would be interesting to take the data from poles (very dense data) and swath of ex-volcanic areas)
 - Sensor fusion
	 - Alignment
	 - Temporal ordering
	 - Superresolution
 - HERE IS THE REWARD - Play with data

## Finish
 - Limitations
 - Potential for further research (hype up my SW as hell, can be used for whatever body, whatever satellite and whatever instrument!)
 - Conclusion
 - Thank you everyone
